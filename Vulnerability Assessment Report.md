# Vulnerability Assessment Report

## System Description  
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on
the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management
system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts
with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

## Scope  
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system.
The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP
800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

## Purpose

The database server is essentially the foundamental resources that our company uses to find potential customers. If said database is accessable to all users publiclly, then we are at risk to leak important customer information as well as potentailly losing them. As a result, it is highly recommended that we take steps to secure the data on the server immediately. 


## Risk Assessment  

Threat source | Threat event | Likelihodd | Severity | Risk |
---|---|---|---|---|
Competitor |  Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3 | 3 | 9 |
Hacker |  Disrupt mission-critical operations | 3 | 3 | 9 |
Customer | Alter/Delete critical information | 3 | 3 | 9 |  

## Approach 

The reason why these three threat source were carefully selected is because these threat sources has the highest likelihood of causing serious damage to our company's operations.
If competitors are able to get their hands on our customer database, we could very well lose a lot of our customer base. Since our database is currently open to the public, these could easily be altered by any malicious hackers. Lastly, customers themselves can unknowingly gain access to our databases and change or delete infomration without knowing it.  

## Remediation Strategy  

We should only allow users who need to use the database to access them, e.g. sales team. Anyone from outside the sales department will have to request access to grant permission. In addition, users from the sales team will need to each have a user account with a strong password as well as MFA. Last but not least, we should only allow corporate IP addresses to access our networks.
